# Summarization of medical history of a patient using NLP
Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent
and flowing summary containing only the main points outlined in the document. Machine learning models are
typically trained to understand documents and distill useful information before outputting the required
summaries. The use of massive data and reports can be used to automate time-consuming tasks by summarizing
the type of inputs based on templates developed to convert semi-structured and unstructured medical reports
into structured reports. First, in terms of text summarization, readers can reduce reading time by using a system
that reproduces the theme of the document while minimizing repetition. Before entering the model used, data is
cleaned and pre-processed using various techniques such as stop-word removal, lemmatization, lower case, etc.
Text summarization is an interesting field of machine learning that is gaining ground more and more. As research
in this area continues, we can expect breakthrough discoveries that will help shorten long text documents
smoothly and accurately.
